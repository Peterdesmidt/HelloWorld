<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Max :). I decided to enroll in Web Page Design mainly because I have always looked at computers as a potential career option. I figured that this class would give me a great start into the world of programming and just computers as a whole. As someone who spends a very fair amount of time surfing the web, I also feel more excited and comfortable taking this class than many others. I'm excited to see how this semester goes!</p>
